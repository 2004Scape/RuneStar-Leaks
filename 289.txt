I spent all afternoon trying to 'upgrade' our achievement system to handle checklists of 32 things.

It doesn't support it (bit checks & signed integers, etc.), and I'd probably mess up the other ~3,500 achievements.

I just decided to remove 1 thing from my list... 😐

It's a misleading number, there are separate IDs for many achievement chains, but internally that's how it works.
