what is 'RuneDay'?

Jagex's internal calendar. Runeday 1 was the launch of the members' version, back in Feb '02. We passed 4500 recently.

In your .rs2 IDE, where exactly are things like 'raw_chicken' etc. defined?

In .obj files.

How exactly does gosub work?

gosub(scriptname) - executes the script called "scriptname", then resumes the current script from where we were.

Engine commands such as inv_del() are green. Script calls such as ~chatnpc() can be set to blue, brown or neither.
