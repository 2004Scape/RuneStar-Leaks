@JagexAsh What are the different var types?

---

Very many. Int, string, NPC-type, NPC-UID, player-UID, LOC-type, OBJ-type, coord, instance-UID and many many more.

---

I mean the vars such as player and npc set by the "setvar" command.

---

That cheat can work on any player variable of any type; they're all ultimately INTs inside the engine.

---

so what other types of variables are there besides player?

---

Data can be stored per player, or per NPC, or per game world.

---

that's it? I would think bank placeholders would need object variables.

It wasn't intended to be an exhaustive list. As you're aware, data can be stored on objects too.
