Hey Ash, are you willing to share the enum format for RuneScript?

---

Looks like this:

---

What is the difference between "namedobj" and "obj"?

---

The language uses different types for "item that was specified in the code" and "item from player input".

---

So is it possible to pass a namedobj to anything that is wanting an obj?

---

Yes, but not vice-versa. The distinction exists to reduce the risk of arbitrary duping bugs.
