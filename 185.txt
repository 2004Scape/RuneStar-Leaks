GE building GFX archive! They'll need converting to the @OldSchoolRS model format next. GE launching in a few weeks.

Are these brand new codes or are they branded off the RS3 version and require conversion to 07RS template?

They'd been updated to a new format at some point after 2007. We have to convert them back, yeah.
