@JagexAsh Would you show one of the quicksort scripts? I'm curious how you guys handle that kind of thing in your language.

In this example, $list is an array of interface component IDs. On each component, text is written. The script is sorting the contents of $list so that the text will be in alphabetical order A-Z, ignoring upper/lower-case.
It's used by the fairy ring menu.
