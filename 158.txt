Here's an example of a drop table... Who can tell me what creature this is for?

Are obj names case sensitive? Because some items like Red_Dragon_Vambraces all have capitals in it.

Nope, not case sensitive.

What about commands like random or mes, are they not case sensitive too?

No commands are case-sensitive. Script declarations such as [label,swan_battle_restart] are also case-insensitive.
