@JagexAsh Any idea why the locating crystal from Shilo Village doesn't activate on this axis?

---

The developer appears to have written messages for distances <200 and >200, but not =200. Nice.

---

Or even just NOT check the distance at all, if the check for <200 had already been failed, since it'd inevitably be >=200 at that point. But my former colleague would still have been inexperienced at the time when he wrote this; he wrote much better stuff in later years.
