@JagexAsh What is inside the pack folder in the runescript editor, and could you possibly show us what does `mesbox` script look like?

The /src (source) folder contains the raw human-readable scripts and models, etc. Those are converted to bytecode by the compiler ("packing") and the result is put in the /pack folder.
