"~" is gosub(), "@" is jump().

---

No difference. If you call a script with ~ or @, you can pass in arguments. If you use "gosub()" or "jump()" you can't.

---

This one's from the Smithing interface.

---

If you jump() or @ to a label, the script stops at the end of the label, or if return() is called.

---

I see. But how would e.g. flax picking work? Referring to the 8-sec respawning, is the script left in the player's context?

The player's script deletes the scenery, specifying a period. A separate thread in the game engine remembers when to restore it.
