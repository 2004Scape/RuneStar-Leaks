I have a random question for @JagexAsh... I've wondered for many years if the Tzhaar-ket-om (obby maul) was intentionally created with only a strength requirement, or was this a happy accident that was (thankfully) never corrected?

It really looks intentional - the dev wrote the skill name twice, with different capitalisation.
