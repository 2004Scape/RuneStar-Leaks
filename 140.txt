When you write a script there is "proc" and "clientscript" as the types, what are the differences? I thought "proc" was if it returned anything, but I see a pic of one that is a proc that returns nothing. (

A "procedure" is a bit of script that can be called from other triggers; it can take up to 50 arguments and return up to 50 values if we like, but it doesn't have to. A clientscript is a bit of script called from an "event" (such as on-click) on an interface component.
