I just created 60 variations of skeleton NPC #diversity

(3400 lines of text...)

Why though isnt that just inefficient data wise?

Not an issue at all.

For perspective; elite sirenic/tectonic armours are over 200 configs.

Good lord i wish their was a better way to organize things i can only imagine the slayer helmet üòê
