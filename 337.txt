Having so many tasks to implement can be quite time consuming. Fortunately, we have means to create the data for these tasks really quickly. A task in the back-end system looks like this:

'Catch 100 Lobsters' Task in the back-end code.

Because all of the tasks have the same parameters, we can quite quickly write a script in Python that takes an Excel document of all the tasks and then get it to write this very repetitive RuneScript for us. Then it's simply a matter of going into the appropriate script and adding the following code to complete a task should the player satisfy the conditions.
