@JagexAsh Could you possibly show us a snippet that's utilising `label` as a parameter? Similar to the labels you passed to "multi5" command in one of the screenshots you posted sometime ago.

---

Here's the other end of that, then:

---

Thanks. I assume you cannot pass arguments to labels then when using jump?

---

Correct. The jump() command can only call a label that expects no arguments. If the label does expect input arguments, the @ syntax must be used instead.
jump() is thus redundant, but is still supported for legacy reasons.

---

So you can just do "@$label1" instead of jump($label1)?

---

Ah, good point - we'd not be able to use the @ notation on a label that's in a variable. It's not a particularly common way of writing script though I'm relatively fond of the approach myself.
