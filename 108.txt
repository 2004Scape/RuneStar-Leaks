Player permanent (used for your bank and worn items), player temporary (used for clue rewards shown on screen) and shared (mostly shops). I understand only the shared ones support restocking in OSRS, though RS3 got something more for the trade restrictions of 2008.

scope=temp and scope=perm for clue rewards and for the bank respectively.
The clue reward one would be defined without any stock listed, so it's empty, and it'd be filled via code when you complete a trail, then displayed, then emptied into your inventory.
