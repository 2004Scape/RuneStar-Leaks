Hey @JagexAsh. Since this is the last DMM Tournament, would you be willing to release the PvP weapon drop rates?

---

If I'm correct, this formula means killing a level 100 monster is MUCH more common than both a level 2 or level 200. Is the drop rate parabolic from levels 0-200? (edit: typo in the last)

---

To clarify this - it would make sense that the actual formula is instead 2/(1000+(x-200)^2) since it shouldn't get less likely as you kill things > 100 combat

---

I don't think I'm misreading this.

---

Looks like your right. Was just wondering since that's not how it was pitched (not your fault). Thanks for digging into it!

We could assume it was meant to be "- 200" like you suggested, since the two sections of the chance curve would then meet at level 200.
