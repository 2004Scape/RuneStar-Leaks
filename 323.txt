@JagexAsh I am curious how shops are defined in the game code, e.g. Horvik's Armour Shop. Do they look somewhat similar to item definitions, some of which you have shown earlier?

---

Each line is Item, default stock, restock time in server ticks.

---

Thank you! May I ask what size=40 means?

---

Maximum number of slots in the shop. Which is unnecessarily high here since different items can't be sold to it, but it's relevant for general stores.

---

Final question: where is the item cost increase/decrease when buying/selling defined?

---

Depends on the code that opens the individual shop.
