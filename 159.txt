Just so people don't get carried away the dialogue differences are very small. I've minimised most of the enums so you just get a taste.

What's the difference between autoint and int?

---

autoint means this enum is indexed sequentially with ints, no gaps, and i cba to type out 0,1,2,3,4 etc int requires you to specify a key

---

an int enum would be like 
val=1,blah
val=3,blah
val=76,blah
