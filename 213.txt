@JagexAsh How do u define player vars in RuneScript?

---

@Chrischis2 To define %myvariable, I'd write this in a ".varp" file:
[myvariable]
type=int (or coord or obj, etc.)
scope=perm (or temp)

---

@JagexAsh Perm is saved on player log out I'm guessing?

---

@Chrischis2 Yes, and temp is not. Why do you care about the details of our syntax?
