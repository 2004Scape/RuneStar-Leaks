All perfect changes, it sounds like pro meele not working was a bug which is pretty weird

So, this is the code that's live now: https://i.imgur.com/DBnJiEc.png
Previously line 32 had:

~playerhit_n_melee(false,randominc(%combat_stat),$delay);

So we were doing all of the hardwork above, calculating the correct value, and then passing in a whole new random number as the damage regardless... Oopsy. :(

21: [label,gargboss_dusk_slash](seq $attack_anim, int $delay)
22: npc_anim($attack_anim,0);
23: anim(%com_defendanim,calc($delay * 30));
24: sound_synth(npc_param(attack_sound),1,0);
25: ~npc_meleeattack;
26: def_int $damage = 0;
27: if (randominc(%combat_stat) > randominc(%com_slashdef))
28: {
29: 	~npc_meleedamage;
30: 	$damage = randominc(%combat_stat);
31: 	if (%prayer_protectfrommelee = ^true) $damage = scale(20,100,$damage);
32: 	~playerhit_n_melee(false,$damage,$delay);
33: }
34: else ~playerhit_n_melee(false,0,$delay);
